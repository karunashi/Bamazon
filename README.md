# Bamazon (Customer & Manager) CLI

## Live Link
 - N/A ~ Application can be interacted via CLI.

## Description on how to use the app
Much like my previous two-three applications, this application also utilizes CLI for interaction. Many of these interactions are possible with Node.js's packages that are intialized in package.json for those wishing to utilize it themselves with the proper dependencies installed (Inquirer and MySQL packages). BamazonCustomer.js is used for the customers' interaction with the Bamazon store's database created via MySQL. BamazonManager.js is available for managers' interaction with Bamazon's database. 

1. Download the repository locally to interact with it in real-time!
2. Open your preferred CLI (Command Line Interface)
3. Extract the downloaded repository into a preferred directory of your choosing.
4. Navigate to the directory that you've placed the downloaded repository in with your CLI.
5. Type node bamazoncustomer.js in your CLI (for customer interaction)
- Navigate through the listing and see what products you would like to purchase.
- The system will allow you to pick how many items you wanted to purchase.
- It will then verify if there's enough in stock to fulfill the purchase order.
6. Type node bamazonmanager.js in your CLI (for manager interaction)
- Navigate through the first menu to either view the full inventory in administrator mode, or to check specifically for low-stock items in the database.


## Requirements
- CLI of your choosing (Terminal, Git Bash, zsh, etc).
- Some software to uncompress the repository you'll be downloading.
- Keyboard to type into the CLI and interact with main.js

## Technologies Used
